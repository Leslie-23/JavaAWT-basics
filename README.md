# Java AWT Example: Simple GUI Window
---

This repository contains a simple Java application demonstrating the usage of Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) to create a graphical user interface (GUI) window with components like buttons and labels.

## Overview

Java AWT is a set of classes and APIs in Java that enables developers to create GUIs for Java applications. It provides a range of components, event-handling mechanisms, layout managers, and graphics capabilities to build interactive user interfaces.

## Features

- Creates a basic GUI window using Java AWT.
- Includes a button ("Click Me!") and a label ("Hello, World!") within the window.
- Demonstrates setting window properties such as size and visibility.

## Getting Started

To run the example code:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the `MyWindow.java` file.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you will see a GUI window with a button and a label. Clicking the button triggers an event that can be further customized based on your application's requirements.

## Dependencies

This project does not have any external dependencies beyond Java itself. Ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine to compile and run the code.
